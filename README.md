# ms-viewer
The idea for MS-viewer is to view manuscripts in a book-like two-page spread, even though the images are only page-by page. In manuscripts you also often have some kind of page-numbering that is full of errors, so you need some way to overcome that and work out which images are recto and which are verso. Also, sometime, you find full-page spreads, so you have three page orientation types.
The prototype viewer, which uses manuscript B78 of the Charles Harpur (1813-1867) archive is a case in point. There are two full-page spreads at pp.138-139. Also three sets of page-numbers: 1-162, then i-v, then 1-78. There is also "front inside cover" and "cover". And you can't derive the recto-verso properties from the file names (00000023.jpg etc.) because of the full-page spreads in the sequence. So the idea of MS-viewer is to provide a JSON object describing each image. Metadata, that is. But typing this would be tedious, so it provides a tool that generates the metadata of the form:
{ "src": "00000234.jpg", "n": "61b", "o": "r" } for each image given a list of exceptions. It then assuems that the items *between* the exceptions are ordered alternately, based on the previous value. So for B78 the list is just:
